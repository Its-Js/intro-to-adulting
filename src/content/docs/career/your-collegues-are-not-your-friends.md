title: Your collegues are not your friends
description: Your collegues can be friendly but are not always your friends per say.

They can be friendly but the
issue comes down to a potential clash in interests. Lets say there is
only one slot available for promotion, would you two resolve it
ammicably? Lets raise the stakes, picture this, their partner just got
laid off recently and could really use the upcoming bonus. However, the
project you all were involved in did not perform, and now they are on
the hook for the results. They can either take the blame, and put
themselves in a deeper hole financially, or they can deflect the blame
to someone else (you). The idea here is not to ask you to question
everyone's morals, but to help you realise that within the workforce,
the best way to maintain relationships is to ensure that your interests
are aligned. Generally, the best way to maintain a friendship between
collegues is if one leaves, then there will no longer be any potential
clash in interests.
