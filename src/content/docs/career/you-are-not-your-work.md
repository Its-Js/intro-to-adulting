title: You are not your work
description: Seperate yourself from your work.

It is rather easy to get overly attached to
your own work, and take critics on your work as personal attacks.
However, these critques may be people trying to improve the project as a
whole. If you get overly attached to your own work, it may cause you to
become overly defensive. For example, the project may need to pivot due
to some new inputs and the work that you have done has to be discarded.
If you do not detach yourself from your work, you may see this as an
attack onto yourself rather than an move to ensure that the project
succeeds.
