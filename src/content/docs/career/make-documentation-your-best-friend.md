title: Make Documentation your best friend
description: On the importance of documenting your work
---

Similar to the example before,
you would not have to worry as much if every step of your involvement
were documented. You just have to pull up the records to defend yourself
in the event of any conflicts. You may also need to bring these up if
there are people taking credit for your work. In general, by documenting
your involvement at work, it helps to protect yourself and reduce future
headaches.
