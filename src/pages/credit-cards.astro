        Credit cards vs Debit cards // Why credit cards? With credit cards, you
        are spending the bank's money while with debit cards, you are spending
        your money. Yes, you have to pay the bank back at the end of the month,
        which makes both cards pretty similar, but there are benefits of using
        credit cards over debit cards.
      </p>

        1. In case of scams/fraud, if you spent it on a credit card, you can
        issue a chargeback or a dispute and the bank will typically be the one
        to investigae and get their money back. If you use a debit card instead,
        you would typically need to resolve it yourself through filing of police
        reports etc. Thus, charging onto a credit card is generally safer.

        2. There are additional rewards that you can get in the form of either
        cash back or miles when you spend with a credit card, that you miss out
        on if you use a debit card. The general rate is about 1-3% return in
        value, which adds up over time. Imagine you spend 1k a month for a year,
        at 1% value, you would be leaving $120 on the table. This amount is a
        pretty conservative estimate and it generally only gets higher from
        here.

        Miles vs Cashback. People generally fall into two camps, miles or
        cashback. With cashback, the concept is quite simple, for every $X
        spent, they will return u 1-3% of that amount, whereas for miles, they
        will give you 1-4 miles per dollar spent.

        Credit cards are not free (mostly). There is an annual fee to most
        credit cards, which is why you have so much benefits. However, you can
        call in to request for a waiver of your credit card fee, and the banks
        may waive it for you, it is said that as you spend more with the credit
        card, the chances of getting the fees waived are higher.
